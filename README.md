### 1. An Introduction
> *"by definition Javascript or JS is a single-thread, dynamic and weak typed programming language."*

Javascript is originally made for a web browser. its used to make a website more live by adding an interaction and functionality, such as click event in a button, scroll event and etc. Since it made for web browser, it can only be execute inside a browser.

Each brower has different engine to run javascript program, for example chrome used what its called `v8engine` and firefox use `SpiderMonkey`.

> NOTE : back in the day where website in its just a static page, mean that its only serve or display a static web page content.

But in the modern era, javascript has envolve. Now days, you can use javascript for making web app, mobile app, or even a desktop app using electron-js. For a developer, it give us a huge benefit, you can make an app by using javascript only and your app can be run in cross-devices platform. to make this posible we need a special tool to make our javascript program can be run outside the browser, since our computer doesn't understand javascript.

We can use NodeJs, a free, cross-platform , and open-sourse javascript runtime environtment to make our computer capable to execute javascript program outside the browser. this special tool used same engine that google chrome browser used to execute javascript.

Also, we need tool to manage our javascript project (create, read, edit, and save .js file) since our brower can't do that. In this case use can use an IDE or light-weight code editor such as atom, sublime or vs-code.
